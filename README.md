# My Restaurant Website

The Restaurant Frontend project aims to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly web interface for a restaurant using React.js and Tailwind CSS. This frontend will provide a seamless experience for customers to explore the restaurant's offerings, make reservations, and order food online. The goal is to enhance customer engagement and streamline the online interaction process, making it easier for users to navigate through the menu, book tables, and place orders.
